A usual day with a friend in my college life.

Let me help with the script:
He always works late at night, at 6 AM morning he goes to sleep,
2hr later, we friends come to call him for morning classes, he gives no response still sleeps,
then we come to call him for lunch, again no response and he sleeps,
then for evening snacks, Hell, still sleeping!
finally its night, and final call for dinner but....
still sleeping :( 
Now there was a big cardboard tube in his room, probably for a project.
we pick it up and one end of the pipe goes close to his left ear, and anther one to a full volume speaker. and now you know the rest XD!

ps: Happy Birthday BoiðŸŽ‚
